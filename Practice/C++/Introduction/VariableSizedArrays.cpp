/* Description :
Consider an n-element array, a, where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of Ki integers 
(where the value of Ki varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array a and j denotes
an index in the array located at a[i]. For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location
a[i] on a new line.

Input Format : The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of 
variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 
describing the k-element array located at a[i].
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a)
and j(an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= q <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 3*10^5
n <= sum(k) <= 3*10^5
0 <= i < n
0 <= j < k

All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 10^6

Output Format : For each pair of i and j values(for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located
at index  of the array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of q lines of output.
